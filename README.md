## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
A relatively straight-forward challenge, but still had some interesting problems, like making sure the button elements
are displayed at full-width.

Also tried a new approach to get as much fine-grained control over the `clamp()` function as possible.

### Useful resources
- [Kevin Powell's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob)\
  Kevin is an amazing teacher, and I based my solution on his many excellent examples.
